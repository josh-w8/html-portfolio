 <h1>The Best Video Games According to Josh</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 video games of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Red Dead Redemption 2</h3>
<p>Utterly brilliant. The expansive open world and attention to detail are second to none.</p>
<h3>Grand Theft Auto V</h3>
<p>As above but a slightly older game and I prefer the Western style genre.</p>
<h3>Skyrim</h3>
<p>Beautiful world design with a great storyline and even better lore. I love the Elder Scrolls franchise and this one tops the lot.</p>
